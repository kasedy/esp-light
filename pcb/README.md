# Eagle project for manufactering pcb

`Light SOT32` pcb uses SOT32 MOSFET's mounted under voltage regultaro
`Light SOT32 bottom` pcb uses SOT32 MOSFET's mounted on the other side of the board
`Light TO-220` pcb uses TO220 MOSFET's for long led strips that requere more power
`Panelized` contains all 3 kind of boards multiplied 4 times. Archive contains all necessary files for manufacterer. Board size does not exceed 100X100mm. It is the smalles and cheappes size. I ordered [here](https://jlcpcb.com/) for $2.
