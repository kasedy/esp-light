# Eagle project for manufactering pcb

`Light SOT32` pcb uses SOT32 MOSFET's mounted under voltage regultar<br/>
`Light SOT32 bottom` pcb uses SOT32 MOSFET's mounted on the other side of the board<br/>
`Light TO-220` pcb uses TO220 MOSFET's for long led strips that requere high power<br/>
`Panelized` contains all 3 kind of boards replicated 4 times. Archive contains all necessary files for a manufacterer. Board size does not exceed 100X100mm. It is the smalles and cheappes size. I ordered [here](https://jlcpcb.com/) for $2.<br/>
